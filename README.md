# Animator-Component

This project demonstrates the implementation of animation control using Unity's Animator component. It is designed as part of a learning exercise to familiarize with Unity Engine's animation components and scene interactions. The main feature is a chest in an isometric adventure scene that opens and closes when the player controller enters and exits a trigger area.

Features

- Animator Component Integration: Attaching an Animator component to a GameObject to enable animations.
- Animation Clips and Transitions: Adding and configuring animation clips within an animator controller and defining transitions for smooth animations.
- Scene Interaction: Implementing trigger areas that detect player presence to initiate animations.

Implementation

- Attaching Animator Component: Integrating the Animator component to the chest GameObject in the scene.
- Creating Animator Controller: Setting up an animator controller with the chest opening and closing animation clips.
- Defining Transitions: Ensuring smooth transitions between animation clips.
- Implementing Trigger Areas: Adding trigger areas around the chest to detect the player controller's presence and initiate the animations.
  
The chest in the scene will open and close dynamically based on player interactions, providing a hands-on experience with Unity's animation system.
